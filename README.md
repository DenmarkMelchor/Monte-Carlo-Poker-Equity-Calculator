# Monte-Carlo-Poker-Equity-Calculator
Calculates equity for Hero against multiple villains while taking into account probable ranges for villains using Monte Carlo simulations.
Written completely in python.
Uses multiprocessing.
Meant for Texas Hold'em Poker.

How to use:
1. Run the .py file in the terminal.
2. Answer the questions in the format required.
3. Receive the Monte Carlo calculation for Hero's probable equity in given situation

Note: The calculation is only approximate and not exact, but it is good enough for practical use. To increase accuracy, you can manually edit the file to run more simulations. There is a comment within the file which explains how to do so. It is relatively intuitive as well.

This is my first python project that I created a long time ago and I thought I might as well share it for other people who might be looking into how to create Monte Carlo simulations in python.
